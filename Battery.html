            <h2>How do Batteries of Cars work</h2>
            <p>Many take their car batteries for granted, but this is an essential part of the car necessary for powering the cars lights, starting it up from a parked position, and much more. Batteries in cars are made up of cells which store chemical energy which can then be transformed into electrical energy on demand. Each cell can produce around 2 volts of energy. Most cars now have 6 cell batteries, meaning the majority of car batteries can produce around 12 volts of electricity on demand. The energy produced by these chemical reactions can be sent to the car engine to start it. This process is reversible however which means the car battery recharges while you drive your car.</p>
            <p>The power provided by the battery is then replaced by the alternator, which is responsible for supplying most of the electrical current to the electrical systems in your car, and for keeping the battery charged.</p>

            <h2> Why you should maintain your car battery!</h2>
            <p>The increased amount of in-car tech such as interactable screens and air conditioning mean more strain is placed on the battery causing modern batteries to have more chances of failing as cars become more advanced, which is why it's important you maintain your car battery.</p>

            <h2>How you can maintain your car battery!</h2>
            <p>One of the ways to maintain your car battery is making sure it has time to recharge. Your car battery is essentially emptied every time you start your car and if you don't drive enough, it may not have enough time to recharge properly, so making many short trips will damage your car in the long run. To avoid this, you could either take longer drives or invest in an intelligent charger. Some warning that your car is dying or about to stop working is if the car cranks lower and takes longer to start up. This may only happen once or twice before the battery completely dies so don't ignore it. Another sign is if you notice you are losing power to any of your electrical systems like your air conditioning or windows. If you notice any of these book an appointment to either replace or fix your car battery. Remember to take care of your car's components if you want it to last a long time and keep its quality.</p>
